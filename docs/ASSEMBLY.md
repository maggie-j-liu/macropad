# Assembling the Macropad

The macropad is made of 3 PCBs stacked on each other. The middle PCB has key switch sockets, LEDs, and female headers soldered on -- the Raspberry Pi Pico (with headers) plugs into the female headers.

## Instructions

1. Push the Raspberry Pi Pico into the headers on the middle PCB, oriented as shown below (with the microUSB port facing up, the switch sockets should be on the left and LEDs should be on the right).

2. Put the switches into the top PCB plate. There are tabs on the switches that can be pressed so that the switches can be inserted more easily.

3. Add keycaps onto the switches and screw standoffs onto the middle PCB. Then push the top PCB onto the middle PCB, aligning the switch pins with the switch sockets.

4. Stick the rubber feet onto the bottom PCB, and screw it onto the standoffs.

5. Plug it into your computer and test it out! If nothing happens, you'll need to [program](./PROGRAMMING.md) it.
